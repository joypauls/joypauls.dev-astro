  Important legislation from MN that sets a 100% clean electricity goal for 2040
---


In 2023, Minnesota passed one of the most ambitious clean energy laws in the country: a Clean Electricity Standard (CES) that requires all utilities in the state to generate 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040. It was a huge win for climate advocates, and a moment of leadership in a region where energy politics can be complex and divisive.

For the full story on the forces that made this landmark law a reality, check out [this episode](https://www.degreespod.com/episodes/season-4-episode-2) of the podcast *A Matter of Degrees*.


## What It Says

The [CES](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?f=SF4&y=2023&ssn=0&b=senate) requires utilities to provide:
1. 80% carbon-free electricity by 2030 (for public utilities; 60% for others)
2. 90% carbon-free electricity by 2035 (all utilities)
3. 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040 (all utilities)

Importantly, these goals are not voluntary, they are mandatory standards backed by oversight and enforcement from the Public Utilities Commission. In addition to the carbon-free mandate, the law also strengthens Minnesota’s previous renewable energy standard, requiring 55% of electricity to come from eligible renewable energy sources by 2035. 

## Eligible Technologies

According to the law, "carbon-free" means "a technology that generates electricity without emitting carbon dioxide". That sounds pretty cut and dry, but there is more nuance laid out in the text. The following are called out as the primary eligible technologies:

- solar
- wind
- small-scale and existing hydropower
- some types of biomass
- existing nuclear plants (MN does not allow new nuclear)

However, the 55% renewable requirement effectively limits how much nuclear power can be in the mix. Between that and the [dramatic cost reductions](https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth), we can expect solar and wind to do the heavy lifting to meet this standard.

### Hydro

Why is new, large-scale hydro left out? It is certainly a renewable resource. As a matter of fact, nearly [6%](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427) of U.S. electricity generated in 2023 came from hydropower plants, even more than solar. There are a few reasons for excluding it in legislation like this:
- It comes with some significant [environmental baggage](https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/why-arent-we-looking-more-hydropower), despite its lack of carbon emissions. Dams can disrupt river ecosystems, harm fish populations, and alter water quality.
- Hydropower has been part of the U.S. grid for [well over a century](https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/history-hydropower). Most of the prime locations for dams are already in use, and new ones often face steep ecological and political opposition.

## Work to Do

While this legislation may have helped cement Minnesota's reputation as a leader in climate policy among the states, there's a lot of work to do to meet the standard. 




Minnesota’s CES sets a bold target and puts the state in the company of climate-forward leaders like California and New York. But as with any big climate law, it's all about implementation. What happens next will depend on strong policy follow-through, local innovation, and continued public engagement.
