<!-- ## Energy -->

The United States accounts for 15% of the world's total energy consumption, despite being home to only 4% of the world's population. It is critically important to understand and address opportunities in the U.S.'s use of energy if we want to decarbonize the world. At the end, we'll see just how much energy we use compared to other big economies.

The data used throughout this entire post is from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/energy), which is originally sourced from the International Energy Agency (IEA).

## Energy Consumption

In this discussion I'll focus first on [primary energy consumption](https://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.php?id=Primary%20energy). The most important thing to know about it is that we are looking at energy consumption for any purpose; that includes energy used as fuel for transportation, energy converted into electricity, and anything in between. I like to think of it as loooking at the raw inputs into our energy ecosystem.
