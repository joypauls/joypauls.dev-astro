<!-- ## Energy -->

The United States accounts for 15% of the world's total energy consumption, despite being home to only 4% of the world's population. It is critically important to understand and address opportunities in the U.S.'s use of energy if we want to decarbonize the world. At the end, we'll see just how much energy we use compared to other big economies.

The data used throughout this entire post is from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/energy), which is originally sourced from the International Energy Agency (IEA).

## Energy Consumption

In this discussion I'll focus mostly on [primary energy consumption](https://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.php?id=Primary%20energy). The most important thing to know about it is that we are looking at energy consumption for any purpose; that includes energy used for fuel for transportation, energy converted into electricity, and anything in between. I like to think of it as loooking at the raw inputs into our energy ecosystem.

Looking at this chart, it's clear that fossil fuels (oil, coal, and natural gas) still dominate our lives.



| Energy Source | 1970 Share    | 2023 Share   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Oil | 44.9% | 38.0% |
| Gas | 31.6% | 33.8% |
| Coal | 18.8% | 8.7% |
| Renewables | 4.4% | 11.7% |
| Nuclear | 0.4% | 7.8% |


Although the vast majority of energy still comes from fossil fuels, fossil fuel usage peaked in 2007 and has been decreasing ever since. Total energy usage has been fairly flat, due in part to the growth of renewables. This is not the whole story though - the transition from fossil fuels to renewables becomes even more clear after adjusting for population growth.

In fact, fossil fuel usage per person has been decreasing since the 70's! Nuclear filled the gap for a while until, starting around 2000, renewables began to take off. Notice the different scales on the left and right axes: despite the growth, an order of magnitude seperates us from living in a renewables-dominant world.




## Renewables on the Rise

Renewable energy use increased by over 150% in the first two decades of the 21st century.

It's important to remember that so far we have been looking energy consumption across all sectors, but we don't utilize each source equally across sectors. The growth in biofuels is primarily driven by its use in the transportation sector, for example.

### Electricity

To truly appreciate the growth in renewables, it is helpful to briefly zoom in on electricity generation, where renewable energy shines.

But it's not enough. X% of our electricity is still generated from fossil fuels


## How We Stack Up

Returning to the topic of primary energy consumption, let's take a look at how the United States energy use compares to the rest of the world.

We saw earlier that adjusting for population can sometimes provide a useful perspective when it comes to energy consumption. It is hardly surprising that China consumes more energy than the U.S. when we consider that China has X times the population! However, the U.S. comes out on top in terms of energy use per person. We see that even just U.S. fossil fuel consumption per capita dwarfs the totals of the other top economies.
